# HANGMAN
## Purpose
This command line version of hangman is a fun way for back end developers to interact with node. The game-based approach allows users step into the terminal in a casual and approachable way. 

## Theme
I developed this app with a travel theme to motivate encourage my users to travel. Stepping outside of your comfort zone is the only way we grow. This app encourages travel and learning new skills, both of which are certain to get users outside of their comfort zone.
